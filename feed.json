And so it appears we didn’t learn a damn thing.</p>\n<p>One of these places is in trouble... actually, all places are in trouble, but we can't be everywhere. So we'll have to follow the story of a small group of inhabitants of this one specific village built on the roof tops of a former city, now renamed as “MudTown”, because... well. It has a lot of mud. <br><br>MudTown’s resources are critically scarce, their taxes are due, and the bully neighboring half-assed kingdom is threatening with a hostile takeover. And by hostile they probably mean: raping, slaughtering and scorching the already scorched land to rule over it's ashes. That kind of hostile.</p>\n<p>MudTown's only hope for survival is to set a small group of common folks with the responsibility of departing to the unknown to save them all. The odds are not good. </p>\n<p>This band of ill-prepared and ill-fitting group, will board their hot-air balloon-airplane hybrid contraption and sail the seven skies in search of the <em><strong>Great New New York</strong>, </em>or... whatever place or situation they can find to help save their townsfolk. They are desperate so they don't get to be picky.</p>\n<p>But they'll sure aim for <strong><em>Great New New York</em></strong>, a place that is said to have electricity, clean waters and even a movie theater with all the classics like the whole Fast &amp; Furious franchise, Back to the Future part 3 and one of those Transformer movies.</p>\n<p>In their travels, they will find many adventures filled with friends and foes. Mostly foes though.<br>They will gain knowledge and experience... and stress, bodily injuries, pain, athletes foot, sunburns, mutant-zombie bites and blisters.</p>\n<p>They will grow as individuals and as a group. They will awe and laugh at what this new wonderful world has to offer. <br>They will also hate each other, fight, scream, curse and vomit in disgust at what this undeadly world throws at them.</p>\n<p>On this adventure they will encounter and fight tyrants, pirates, mutants, cannibals, monsters and communists. <br><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">They will also fight regular folks, gravity, mosquitoes, neo-feudalist lords, evil capitalists, all sorts of </span><span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">fanatics, police and probably some giant cockroaches<strong>*</strong>.</span></p>\n<p>It won't be easy to save their people from impending doom, but we will try to have fun watching them try, fail and succeed. Mostly fail though.</p>\n<pre><br><span style=\"color: #100ea4;\"><em>*<strong>Note to self:</strong> Add giant cockroaches all over the place**.</em></span><br><span style=\"color: #ba372a;\"><em><strong>**Note from editor: </strong>Just...
